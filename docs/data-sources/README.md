# Data Sources

Autobase currently supports the following data sources:
- CSV

## CSV

A CSV (Comma Separated Values) file used with Autobase should have the following structure:

- The first row must contain the headers (column names).
- The subsequent rows should contain the data.
- All rows must have values for all columns (i.e., Number of columns in each row should be equal to the number of columns in the header row).

### Example

```csv
roll,name,age,score,height
12,John Doe,20,85,175
31,Jane Smith,22,90,165
18,Bob Johnson,21,78,180
21,Alice Brown,23,88,170
```
